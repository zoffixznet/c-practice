"Stupid people don’t always know that they’re stupid. They might be aware
that something is wrong, they might notice that things don’t usually turn
out the way they imagined, but very few of them think it’s because of
them. That they’re the root of their own problems, so to speak. And
that sort of thing can be very difficult to explain."
